# Modules, Libraries and Packages 
## --> Specifically pyodbc package

### Libraries
Refer to python standard libraries. They come standard with python
but need to be imported.

### Modules
These are python files / like our MonsterStudent that we import
into our programs.
We create and import our own modules internally.

### Packages
These are external modules that we need to install (externally)
and then import them.

These are modules usually written in OOP style that abstracts 
something.

These things that are abstracted include:
- connection to a service (google maps or google image api,
price of stocks, price of bitcoin.)
- Tools / Calculators (prime number calculator, other complex
calculators)
- Front end tools - Like JS compiler or other things like scss
- Full fledged frameworks
- connections to Databases or using HTTP protocols 


### Searching
google
look at good git repos
previous experience
https://pypi.org/

### Installing
pip - pythons package manager
(deals with dependencies and installs in virtual environment)
- using command line

pycharm - you can just add interpreter

### Using

- import and call your functions
- follow the documentation

## PYODBC
This package allows us to connect to a DB

## Task - complete run.py file
1) As a user I can create a passenger
2) As a user I can list all flights
3) as a user I can add_passenger to flight

4) Go to MS SQL SERVER and create the 3 tables for:
- passenger
- flight
- planes
These should have all the column they need
(first_name, last_name, passport_num)

5) Add one data point to each table

6) Try to connect via your python project
